# Overview

## Scope

The GEP is an open portal for electrification investment data, analysis
and research. It is being designed upon the principles of openness and
transparency and aspires to enable reusability, replicability and
reproducibility of embedded processes and data. Based on these
principles, GEP output is available in three levels:

  - **Level 1 - GEP Explorer**: Up-to-date and openly accessible electrification investment outlooks
  - **Level 2 - GEP Generator**: Open source UI for generating electrification outlooks on the fly
  - **Level 3 - GEP Toolbox**: Open access and fully-fledged documentation and training material

In addition, the GEP ecosystem has been designed as such to support
collaboration and interoperability between institutions, modellers and
practitioners engaged in the field of energy access. This is achieved:

  - By jointly developing data standards and processing protocols so
    that disparate practices, software and data can be aligned and
    streamlined.
  - By means of modular configuration, through which different targets
    can be reached; Data, model and result customization and update is
    possible on the fly.
  - By means of regular and community-inclusive annual updates through
    which new data, methods, and results can be absorbed as they emerge.

## Target audience

The GEP aspires therefore to attract four primary target audiences:

>   - **High level decision makers** will use output from the GEP
>     Explorer that produces geo-infographic investment options for
>     all target countries.
>   - **Policy and investment analysts** will use the GEP Scenario
>     Generator to develop tailored scenarios to meet specific policy
>     or investment goals.
>   - **Data producers and ICT developers** will use the GEP Toolbox
>     and have a target into which additional information and methods
>     can be utilized (with global impact).
>   - **Global development organizations** will have a platform for
>     country outreach. The software provides a springboard for tailored
>     analysis and engagement from academia to project developers.

The GEP (in its current format and version) is built upon characteristics and functionalities of the Open Source Spatial Electrification Tool ([OnSSET](http://www.onsset.org/)). The GEP team is constantly working on collecting feedback from other institutions active in the geospatial electrification modelling (Columbia University, MIT, NRECA, RLI and others) in order to update and expand GEP's interoperability.

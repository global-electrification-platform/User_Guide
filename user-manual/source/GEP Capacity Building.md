# Capacity Building
Capacity Building is a main pillar of the Global Electrification Platform (GEP) Initiative. Open-source tools and data are emphasized for the training as they play a crucial role in national energy modelling capabilities needed by countries to achieve universal access to modern energy services by 2030 (SDG7).  

The capacity building activities are focused on geospatial across governments, development partners and private sector agents. The GEP team has run four capacity building events and has established an annual training in Trieste, Italy in June. If you are interested in participating in the training as either a participant or as a trainer, please do not hesitate to contact the [GEP Team](https://gep-user-guide.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Contact.html). 

## Past Capacity Building Activities 
So far, the following capacity building activities have been hosted as part of this initiative: 
1. Ethiopia, Addis Ababa, January 2018  
2. [Italy, Trieste, June 2018](https://global-electrification-platform.github.io/User_Guide/user-manual/source/PDFs/Summary_SDSS_Trieste2018_public_version.pdf)
3. [South Africa, Cape Town, January 2019](https://global-electrification-platform.github.io/User_Guide/user-manual/source/PDFs/Summary_EMP-A_2019_public_version.pdf)
4. [Italy, Trieste, June 2019](https://global-electrification-platform.github.io/User_Guide/user-manual/source/PDFs/Summary_SDSS_Trieste2019_public_version.pdf)

More than 70 trainees have already participated in regional training efforts hosted by the World Bank. Most of the trainees were from Sub Saharan African (SSA) countries. In total, the capacity building activities received trainees from almost 20 SSA countries. This accounts for about 40 % of all SSA countries. Beyond SSA, the training sessions also received participants from other countries, such as Tunisia, Haiti, Myanmar, Brazil, Uruguay, Afganistan and Italy. The Figure below indicates the countries that successfully received training during 2019 in turquoise and 2018 in hashed.

# Data Standards
Data are fundamental to the Global Electrification Platform, and as such, we have put effort into documenting the data input and output standards in order to facilitate easier data exchange with our partners.

As a jumping off point, [we have published the data standards](https://global-electrification-platform.github.io/User_Guide/user-manual/source/data_standards/GEP_DataStandards_v1.xlsx). We are continuously working with partners and clients to identify commonalities in our data collection and our data needs and work towards data conversion tools that allow for easier integration of new data into all our processes.

If you are interested in collaborating on data standards, please contact the GEP team, or [follow up at this Github repository](https://github.com/global-electrification-platform/User_Guide)

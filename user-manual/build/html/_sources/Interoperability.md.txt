# GEP Interoperability

The GEP is expected to be a part of a continuous data and model
discovery process. This process will discover and
develop new data via remote sensing, machine learning, development of
new theory and modelling. New data will be compiled, processed in models
and new information is expected to be produced during the operation of
the GEP. To ensure that new data and models can easily be integrated to the GEP
ecosystem, guidelines for its form and description, as well as handling
protocols have been developed.

## Data guidelines

The GEP team has put together a list of input/output datasets and parameters that are common
between several GIS based electrification modelling tools. Each
dataset/parameter comes along with suggested standards and metadata
describing several characteristics that are important in the integration
process. These include type, format, source, author and licence among
others.

The list is available [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1O3N1vrGJtLEPN4_3_KxJDxqc4cCEo2H9/view)

In this stage, the above list was informed based on the functionalities of OnSSET.
However, the GEP team is collecting feedback from other institutions 
active in the geospatial electrification modelling in order to update and expand the current list.

## GEP annual updates

Every year an updated version of the GEP will be released. This will include an
annual suite of Electrification Investment Scenarios (EISs) on GEP Explorer, providing 
a set of least cost investment scenarios for each target country. These updates will reflect 
advances in algorithms and models, improvements in data input, as well as increased scenarios 
defined by increasingly relevant and available 'levers'.

A process will be set up for active updating in collaboration with partners 
such that the latest available modelling, data and analysis is both used and compatible with
the GEP. Similarly, each year, advances in standards and updated teaching material will be released.

Official release of the annual update is expected to take place in the last quarter of each year. 
Call for inputs and collaboration will be made after the annual release.
